I am glad I choose this class as it made me get familiar with Github. This is my first time using Github, and I am glad that this course was helpful for me to get familiar with the Github Classroom and Pull/Push requests.

I am still very confused about the Github environment, but I believe I will be able to clear my doubts once I regularly stary using Github.
